1. This is an app where the user can earn money by clicking on hamburgers, and use the money to upgrade, invest, or buy real estate.


## Features

* Once the user has chosen a username and whether to start from the "Beginning" or from "Saved Data", the game will start. When user enters their username, they can type "cheater" to start as a millionaire.
